ZZ QOL — Plus (Light Automation)

Goal
- Automate tedious click-work the player can do manually. Keeps gameplay identical; just fewer repetitive actions.

Cascades
- Depends on: zz-qol-lite >= 1.0.0 (includes all Lite visibility tools)

Includes (with why)
- AutoDeconstruct >= 1.0.7 — flags empty miners for deconstruction so outposts self‑maintain.
- EvenDistributionLite >= 1.4.4 — evenly spreads items across inventories to avoid micro.
- EditorExtensions >= 2.5.0 — small utility helpers/shortcuts; improves console/UX without creative powers.
- pump >= 2.1.13 — smoother fluid connection placement and behavior.
- mining-patch-planner >= 1.7.2 — clean ore‑patch selection for tidy drill layouts.
- manual-inventory-sort >= 2.3.0 — one‑key inventory sorting to stay organized.

Next tiers
- For heavier helpers, add: qol-3-max (mod id: zz-qol-max)
- For creator tools, add: qol-4-editor (mod id: zz-qol-editor)
