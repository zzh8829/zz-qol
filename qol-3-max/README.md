ZZ QOL — Max (Heavier QoL)

Goal
- Strong build/maintenance helpers that respect survival play. Faster construction and upkeep without creative‑mode powers.

Cascades
- Depends on: zz-qol-plus >= 1.0.0 (includes Plus and Lite tiers)

Includes (with why)
- blueprint-shotgun >= 0.2.11 — paint/erase areas with blueprints; extremely fast edits.
- squeak-through-2 >= 0.1.2 — slimmer collision lets you walk between tight builds.
- inventory-repair >= 20.0.3 — auto‑repairs from your inventory when possible.

Next tiers
- For creator tools and terraforming, add: qol-4-editor (mod id: zz-qol-editor)
