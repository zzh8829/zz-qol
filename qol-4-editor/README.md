Goal
- God/creator tools for map work, testing, and megabase grooming outside normal progression.

Cascades
- Depends on: zz-qol-max >= 1.0.0 (inherits all Max, Plus, and Lite tools)

Includes (with why)
- Waterfill >= 0.1.1 — place water tiles to create lakes/canals for testing and world shaping.

Notes
- Use on creative/sandbox saves or when acting as a map editor in co‑op runs.
